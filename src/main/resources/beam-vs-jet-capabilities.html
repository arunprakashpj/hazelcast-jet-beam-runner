<h1 id="what" style="color:#ca1;">What is being computed?</h1>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li> <b><span style="color:#ca1;">&#x2713; ParDo</span></b>:
        Element-wise transformation parameterized by a chunk of user code. Elements are processed in bundles, with
        initialization and termination hooks. Bundle size is chosen by the runner and cannot be controlled by user code.
        ParDo processes a main input PCollection one element at a time, but provides side input access to additional PCollections.
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#ca1;">&#x2713; GroupByKey</span></b>:
        Grouping of key-value pairs per key, window, and pane. Uses the Beam code for grouping by window.
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <li> <b><span style="color:#ca1;">&#x2713; Flatten</span></b>:
        Concatenates multiple homogenously typed collections together.
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#ca1;">&#x2713; Combine</span></b>:
        Application of an associative, commutative operation over all values ("globally") or over all values associated
        with each key ("per key"). Can be implemented using ParDo, but often more efficient implementations exist.
        Fully supported but inefficient, uses default Beam translation.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#ca1;">&#x7E; Composite Transforms</span></b>:
        Allows easy extensibility for library writers. In the near future, we expect there to be more information
        provided at this level -- customized metadata hooks for monitoring, additional runtime/environment hooks, etc.
        Partially supported via inlining
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#ca1;">&#x7E; Side Inputs</span></b>:
        Side inputs are additional PCollections whose contents are computed during pipeline execution and then made accessible to DoFn code.
        The exact shape of the side input depends both on the PCollectionView used to describe the access pattern
        (interable, map, singleton) and the window of the element from the main input that is currently being processed.
        Supported only when the side input source is bounded and windowing uses global window.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#ca1;">&#x2713; Source API</span></b>:
        Allows users to provide additional input sources. Supports both bounded and unbounded data. Includes hooks
        necessary to provide efficient parallelization (size estimation, progress information, dynamic splitting, etc).
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#ca1;">&#x2715; Splittable DoFn (SDF)</span></b>:
        Allows users to develop DoFn's that process a single element in portions ("restrictions"), executed in parallel or
        sequentially. This supersedes the unbounded and bounded `Source` APIs by supporting all of their features on a
        per-element basis. See http://s.apache.org/splittable-do-fn. Design is in progress on achieving parity with
        Source API regarding progress signals. Not implemented, not planning on doing it either.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#ca1;">&#x7E; Metrics</span></b>:
        Allow transforms to gather simple metrics across bundles in a PTransform. Provide a mechanism to obtain both
        committed and attempted metrics. Semantically similar to using an additional output, but support partial results
        as the transform executes, and support both committed and attempted values. Will likely want to augment Metrics
        to be more useful for processing unbounded data by making them windowed. Supported to a degree required for running
        Nexmark tests; doesn't differentiate between committed and attempted metrics
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#ca1;">&#x7E; Stateful Processing</span></b>:
        Allows fine-grained access to per-key, per-window persistent state. Necessary for certain use cases (e.g.
        high-volume windows which store large amounts of data, but typically only access small portions of it;
        complex state machines; etc.) that are not easily or efficiently addressed via Combine or GroupByKey+ParDo.
        <span style="color:red">Should work, needs testing (2 hours).</span>
    </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="where" style="color:#37d;">Where in event time?</h1>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li> <b><span style="color:#37d;">&#x2713; Global windows</span></b>:
        The default window which covers all of time. (Basically how traditional batch cases fit in the model.)
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#37d;">&#x2713; Fixed windows</span></b>:
        Fixed-size, timestamp-based windows. (Hourly, Daily, etc)
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#37d;">&#x2713; Sliding windows</span></b>:
        Possibly overlapping fixed-size timestamp-based windows (Every minute, use the last ten minutes of data.)
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#37d;">&#x2713; Session windows</span></b>:
        Based on bursts of activity separated by a gap size. Different per key.
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#37d;">&#x2713; Custom windows</span></b>:
        All windows must implement BoundedWindow, which specifies a max timestamp. Each WindowFn assigns elements to an associated window.
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#37d;">&#x2713; Custom merging windows</span></b>:
        A custom WindowFn additionally specifies whether and how to merge windows.
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#37d;">&#x2713; Timestamp control</span></b>:
        For a grouping transform, such as GBK or Combine, an OutputTimeFn specifies (1) how to combine input timestamps
        within a window and (2) how to merge aggregated timestamps when windows merge.
        Fully supported.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="when" style="color:#6a4;">When in processing time?</h1>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li> <b><span style="color:#6a4;">&#x2713; Configurable triggering</span></b>:
        Triggering may be specified by the user (instead of simply driven by hardcoded defaults).
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#6a4;">&#x2713; Event-time triggers</span></b>:
        Triggers that fire in response to event-time completeness signals, such as watermarks progressing.
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#6a4;">&#x2713; Processing-time triggers</span></b>:
        Triggers that fire in response to processing-time advancing.
        Fully supported. <span style="color:red">Should work, needs testing (2 hours).</span>
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#6a4;">&#x2713; Count triggers</span></b>:
        Triggers that fire after seeing at least N elements.
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#6a4;">&#x2715; [Meta]data driven triggers</span></b>:
        Triggers that fire in response to attributes of the data being processed.
        No runner supports it.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#6a4;">&#x2713; Composite triggers</span></b>:
        Triggers which compose other triggers in more complex structures, such as logical AND, logical OR, early/on-time/late, etc.
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#6a4;">&#x2713; Allowed lateness</span></b>:
        A way to bound the useful lifetime of a window (in event time), after which any unemitted results may be materialized,
        the window contents may be garbage collected, and any addtional late data that arrive for the window may be discarded.
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#6a4;">&#x2713; Timers</span></b>:
        A fine-grained mechanism for performing work at some point in the future, in either the event-time or processing-time domain.
        Useful for orchestrating delayed events, timeouts, etc in complex state per-key, per-window state machines.
        Fully supported. <span style="color:red">Should work, needs testing (2 hours).</span>
    </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how" style="color:#b55;">How do refinements relate?</h1>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li> <b><span style="color:#b55;">&#x2713; Discarding</span></b>:
        Elements are discarded from accumulated state as their pane is fired.
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#b55;">&#x2713; Accumulating</span></b>:
        Elements are discarded from accumulated state as their pane is fired.
        Fully supported.
    </li>
    <li> <b><span style="color:#b55;">&#x2715; Accumulating & Retracting</span></b>:
        Elements are accumulated across multiple pane firings and old emitted values are retracted. Also known as "backsies" ;-D
        No runner supports it.
